Odysseus' descent, clearly, was a little hairy.

The robot was supposed to come straight down, vertically, with a speed of one metre per second.

In the event, it had navigation issues whereby the onboard computer couldn't process precise laser range-finding data fast enough and had to rely solely on optical cameras for altitude and velocity information.

It meant the craft actually came in three times faster than it should have, and with an element of sideways movement that resulted in a skid.

"The landing gear took the bulk of the load and we broke one or two possibly landing gear," explained Steve Altemus, IM's CEO and co-founder.

"We sat there upright with the engine firing for a period of time. And then, as it wound down, the vehicle just gently tipped over, and in our simulation with 1)3 gravity, we showed that it took about two seconds."

Odysseus is thought to be resting on one of its yellow helium pressure tanks at an angle to the surface of roughly 30 degrees.

The craft was forced to communicate with Houston via its low-gain antennas. But once controllers got the hang of how the signals were being sent, a broad data stream was established.
